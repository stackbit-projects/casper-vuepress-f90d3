No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. I'm nobody's taxi service;I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! you! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. __It's a fez.__ *I wear a fez now.* Fezes are cool.

## You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

1. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
2. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?
3. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

### You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

* It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!
* It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
* I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You've swallowed a planet! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

You hit me with a cricket bat. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.
