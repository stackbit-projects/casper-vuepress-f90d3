This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! A sexy mistake. Look, last night was a mistake. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. No, I'm Santa Claus! Anyone who laughs is a communist!

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. __Also Zoidberg.__ *Is that a cooking show?* Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.

## Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

1. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?
2. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
3. Well, then good news! It's a suppository.

### Bite my shiny metal ass.

I can explain. It's very valuable. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

* Shut up and get to the point!
* You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!
* What are their names?

You are the last hope of the universe. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Look, last night was a mistake. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? It doesn't look so shiny to me. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Pansy.

No! Don't jump! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Anyone who laughs is a communist! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. With gusto. Soothe us with sweet lies. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Then we'll go with that data file! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Is that a cooking show? Yes! In your face, Gandhi!

Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Also Zoidberg. Large bet on myself in round one. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

They're like sex, except I'm having them! You are the last hope of the universe. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
