I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! __You are the last hope of the universe.__ *I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.* Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

## Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

It's a T. It goes "tuh". The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Say what? You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

1. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.
2. Oh yeah, good luck with that.
3. Leela's gonna kill me.

### It's toe-tappingly tragic!

Oh yeah, good luck with that. You're going to do his laundry? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Can I use the gun? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

* Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.
* Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
* Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Is that a cooking show? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! We don't have a brig. I never loved you. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

We don't have a brig. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. What are their names? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Bender, we're trying our best. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!

Why did you bring us here? I just told you! You've killed me! Ask her how her day was. It's toe-tappingly tragic!

How much did you make me? No! The cat shelter's on to me. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

You know, I was God once. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!

And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. No! The cat shelter's on to me. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Oh yeah, good luck with that. No! Don't jump! And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Bender, we're trying our best. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? Hello Morbo, how's the family? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
