When will that be? Kif might! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Okay, I like a challenge. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

<!-- more -->

That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. __You even love anyone pretending to be him!__ *Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack!* I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

## Actually, that's still true.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Can I use the gun? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

1. I don't want to be rescued.
2. A true inspiration for the children.
3. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

### You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

Why would I want to know that? Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

* That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
* My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
* Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Why would a robot need to drink? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

Hello Morbo, how's the family? Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Noooooo! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? When will that be? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

Who are you, my warranty?! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? They're like sex, except I'm having them! I'll get my kit! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!

Take me to your leader! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Why did you bring us here?

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Then we'll go with that data file! You lived before you met me?! We're rescuing ya.

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

No argument here. Yeah, lots of people did. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Shut up and take my money! Hey, whatcha watching?

You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? So, how 'bout them Knicks? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

You wouldn't. Ask anyway! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
