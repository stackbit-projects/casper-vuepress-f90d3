In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. And until then, I can never die? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. It must be wonderful.

No, she'll probably make me do it. Bender, we're trying our best. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. __What am I, the pope?__ *Robot 1-X, save my friends!* And Zoidberg!

## Bender, quit destroying the universe!

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Leela's gonna kill me. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

1. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
2. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
3. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

### Shut up and take my money!

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

* Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.
* Who am I making this out to?
* Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

So, how 'bout them Knicks? Daylight and everything. Pansy. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Do a flip!

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! No. We're on the top.

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. And then the battle's not so bad? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Fatal. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Actually, that's still true. They're like sex, except I'm having them! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Okay, I like a challenge. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Tell her she looks thin. Bite my shiny metal ass.

Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". I just told you! You've killed me! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
