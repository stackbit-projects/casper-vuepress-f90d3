Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Goodbye, cruel world. __Goodbye, cruel lamp.__ *Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords.* Cruel though they may be… Now what?

## Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

1. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
2. I'll get my kit!
3. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

### Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

* There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!
* I love you, buddy!
* Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

Do a flip! But I've never been to the moon! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! And until then, I can never die?

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

I'm a thing. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. Bender?! You stole the atom.

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. That's not soon enough!

Who are you, my warranty?! Ummm…to eBay? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Also Zoidberg. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Who are those horrible orange men?

I'll get my kit! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Can I use the gun? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
