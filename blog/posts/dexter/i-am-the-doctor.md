Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You've swallowed a planet! I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. __Call me the Rotmeister.__ *No, I'm the Doctor.* Don't call me the Rotmeister.

## I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

1. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.
2. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

### Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

* Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
* No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.
* I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
